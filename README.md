# RAG System: Enhancing Semantic Search with OpenAI and Elastic Cloud

This project implements a semantic search engine using OpenAI's language models and Elasticsearch. The goal is to enhance search capabilities by understanding the context and meaning of queries rather than relying solely on keyword matching.

## Project Overview

In this project, we leverage OpenAI's powerful language models to perform semantic search on a dataset indexed in Elasticsearch. By integrating these technologies, the search engine can return more relevant results based on the meaning of the search queries. The project utilizes the "multilingual-e5-small" model deployed in Elasticsearch Cloud for generating embeddings.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for the implementation.
- **OpenAI API**: For natural language processing and understanding.
- **Elasticsearch Cloud**: A managed service for Elasticsearch that simplifies setup and scaling.
- **Machine Learning Model**: "multilingual-e5-small" for generating embeddings.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and visualization.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/meetchauhan1716/rag-system-elasticsearch.git
   cd repository

2. **Install the required packages**:
    Make sure you have Python installed, then run:
   ```bash
       "pip install -r requirements.txt"

4. **Set up Elasticsearch Cloud**:
    Follow the Elasticsearch Cloud documentation "https://www.elastic.co/cloud/" to create an account and set up your Elasticsearch cluster.

5. **Obtain OpenAI API Key**:
    Sign up at OpenAI and get your API key. Set it as an environment variable:

         export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key'
   
7. **Configure Elasticsearch Connection**:
      Update your connection settings in the code to point to your Elasticsearch Cloud instance.

## Usage
   To run the project, open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells in order. The notebook includes:
   Data preprocessing steps
   Indexing data into Elasticsearch using the "multilingual-e5-small" model for embeddings
   Querying Elasticsearch using OpenAI's models
   Evaluating search results
   Example command to start Jupyter Notebook:
   
      jupyter notebook Semantic_Search_with_openai_Elasticsearch.ipynb
