# Semantic Search with OpenAI and Elasticsearch

This project implements a semantic search engine using OpenAI's language models and Elasticsearch. The goal is to enhance search capabilities by understanding the context and meaning of queries rather than relying solely on keyword matching.

## Project Overview

In this project, we leverage OpenAI's powerful language models to perform semantic search on a dataset indexed in Elasticsearch. By integrating these technologies, the search engine can return more relevant results based on the meaning of the search queries. The project utilizes the "multilingual-e5-small" model deployed in Elasticsearch Cloud for generating embeddings.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for the implementation.
- **OpenAI API**: For natural language processing and understanding.
- **Elasticsearch Cloud**: A managed service for Elasticsearch that simplifies setup and scaling.
- **Machine Learning Model**: "multilingual-e5-small" for generating embeddings.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and visualization.

## Installation
